Notes

Language-specific feature adaptations:

The C function main() is translated into a Python function named main(), and the script is executed using the common if name == 'main' idiom.
The C standard output functions (printf and putchar) are replaced by sys.stdout.write() in Python to maintain exact behavior regarding output formatting (i.e., no automatic newline printing as with Python’s print()).
Type system differences:

In C, characters are typically represented as char, while in Python, they are simply strings of length 1.
The C octal literal 07 is converted to a Python character using chr(7) to reproduce the bell character.
Standard library equivalents:

Instead of sleep(1) from unistd.h, Python’s time.sleep(1) from the time module is used.
sys.stdout.write() and sys.stdout.flush() from the sys module are used to exactly control output similar to putchar.
Error Handling:

The original C code has no explicit error handling, so the Python translation directly implements the functionality without additional error checks.
Formatting:

All comments and formatting from the original C code have been preserved and adapted to Python inline comments.
Infinite loop:

The C infinite loop (for(;;)) is translated into a Python while True loop.
Overall, every single line of the C code has been translated exactly as specified, preserving the logic and structure without any assumptions or placeholders.
